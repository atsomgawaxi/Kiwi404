# July 11 (Official Start)
Started making the schematic today, i'm using EasyEDA since i find it easier to upload everything to JLCPCB when i'm done, plus, it has the built-in LCSC page.
Since i'm doing a project similar to the Flipper, i thought of using a stronger MCU (the MCU it comes with is the STM32WB55RG). But the "strongest" thing i found, was a different package with more pins than the RG (the VG package). But since i'm doing my own kind of spin-off of it, i'm planning on adding it's original features, plus some features that aren't on the normal flipper that are nice to have, without relying on a external module, that is. So it is nice having extra pins.
I don't really plan on doing my own firmware for it though, i just plan on making a build of it's original open-sourced firmware that is compatible with my hardware. Since it's a lot of modules to code in, and there probably aren't many code libraries for them. So it's way more viable (and faster) to reuse the Flipper's original firmware.
**I also need to do this FAST, since Highway ends in the 31st.**

This was mostly a research day, since i needed to know about the original Flipper's specs and properties, so i didn't do much on the schematics.

**Time spent: 3h**

God, how i hate and love EasyEDA at the same time, it has some weird controls and lack of keyboard shortcuts, like, what do you mean i have to go out of my way to the top toolbar to simply rotate a component instead of just pressing R? Anyways, i'm planning to do most stuff like the original Flipper, things like power, some of the MCU wiring, that sort of stuff.
